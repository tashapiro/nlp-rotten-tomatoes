Rotten,Robert Ebert,1,--,"Like Father, Like Son (1987)","[This] is one of the most desperate comedies I've ever seen, and no wonder. The movie's premise doesn't work -- not at all, not even a little, not even part of the time -- and that means everyone in the movie looks awkward and silly all of the time. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,1,0.81,Real Life (1979),"A great idea. But the movie that Albert Brooks has made from it, alas, gets most of its laughs in the first 10 minutes, slides into a long middle stretch of repetitive situations and ends on a note of embarrassing hysteria. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,1,0.57,Garbo Talks (1984),"Garbo Talks started out as a great idea for a movie, and when it's over, it's still a great idea for a movie, but the problem is, there are no great ideas in between. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,1,--,"I, A Woman, Part II (1968)","If you can miss only one movie this year, make it I, A Woman. Here is a Swedish film which very nearly restores my faith in the cinema, demonstrating that all the other crummy movies I've had to sit through in this job weren't so bad. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,1,--,The Immortal Bachelor (1975),"It assembles characters of such incredible stupidity that we instantly lose interest in them, and then marches them through a plot so mechanical that we can anticipate everything that happens. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,1,--,Alphabet City (1984),"Maybe in another movie these actors could have made their characters come alive. In Alphabet City, everything is smothered in the concept. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,1,0.43,Hitler: The Last Ten Days (1973),"There's no tragedy in this movie, no sense of the vast scale of suffering outside the bunker. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,1,--,Jekyll and Hyde... Together Again (1982),"This kind of movie, the slapstick, anything-goes satire, is getting awfully old very fast. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,1,--,Night Games (1980),"Well, the movie's premise is obviously shoddy. But is the movie's visual strategy any better? Are we really thrilled by those nighttime chases through the deserted mansion? Not really. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,1,--,Why Would I Lie? (1980),"Why Would I Lie? made me very angry while I was watching it, because it is both a glorification of the arrogant stupidity of its central character, and an insult to the intelligence of its audience. Not a bad double play. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,1,--,"A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die (1968)","[A] bad, artless, stupid movie. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,1,--,Framed (1974),"I suppose movies like this are a living for Baker, but if he wants to put together any kind of career he should choose more carefully. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,1,--,Sharks' Treasure (1975),The movie's never convincing enough to really involve us. -Chicago Sun-Times
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,The Amateur (1982),"After earning our attention with its understated, powerful opening, the movie develops into a routine, even laughable, spy thriller. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Eight on the Lam (1967),"Bob Hope has given the screen some of its most amusing moments, but Eight on the Lam, unfortunately, contains none of them. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,0.69,Don Juan DeMarco (1995),"Brando doesn't so much walk through this movie as coast, in a gassy, self-indulgent performance no one else could have gotten away with. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Brimstone and Treacle (1982),"Brimstone and Treacle performs an unexpected feat, making its startling subject matter into a sigh, not a shriek, of scandal. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Clair de Femme (1979),"Clair de Femme is one of those movies that provides a strange two-level- viewing experience: It moves along for two hours looking exactly like a great idea for a movie, but it never quite becomes the movie. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Jack of Diamonds (1967),"Jack of Diamonds is a harmless exercise in how not to make a suspense adventure. I can't think of any reason to go and see it, unless you're a George Hamilton fan. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,0.61,History of the World: Part I (1981),"Mel Brooks's movie History of the World, Part 1 is a rambling, undisciplined, sometimes embarrassing failure from one of the most gifted comic filmmakers around. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,National Lampoon's Class Reunion (1982),"National Lampoon's Class Reunion has its funny moments, but they're rare enough that we're acutely aware of them. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,0.87,The Warriors (1979),"No matter what impression the ads give, this isn't even remotely intended as an action film. It's a set piece. It's a ballet of stylized male violence. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,0.57,Malice (1993),"Offhand, this is the only movie I can recall in which an entire subplot about a serial killer is thrown in simply for atmosphere. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,0.6,Union City (1980),"Reichert's film is self-consciousness about what he's doing, and that becomes a problem. Not a frame of this film is permitted to express a spontaneity of its own. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,If You Could See What I Hear (1982),Relentlessly trivial. -Chicago Sun-Times
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Jimmy the Kid (1982),"Since Jimmy the Kid is basically a kid's movie, it's too bad they didn't empathize more with the kids in their potential audience. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,"Those Lips, Those Eyes (1980)","Since the movie's center is wrong, not much of anything works. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,0.83,Starting Over (1979),"Starting Over actually feels sort of embarrassed at times, maybe because characters are placed in silly sitcom situations and then forced to say lines that are supposed to be revealing and real. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,0.5,Author! Author! (1982),That unwillingness to really be about its characters is fatal to Author! Author! -Chicago Sun-Times
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,0.9,The Secret Policeman's Other Ball (1981),"The material photographed in The Secret Policeman's Other Ball is sometimes pretty funny, but it tends to get sidetracked by the low-budget videotape recording of the show, and the result is seen through a lens, darkly. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Gable and Lombard (1976),The movie takes a fan-magazine approach to filmmaking - it's all dressing rooms and autograph hounds and world premieres. -Chicago Sun-Times
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Coast to Coast (1980),"The narrative strategy of Coast to Coast is to repeat the same scenes over and over again, in the hope that if they've worked once, who knows? Maybe they'll work again. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,0.4,A Time for Dying (1969),"Too slight, too flat and too unintentionally ludicrous. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing (1975),You can't really get stirred up about a movie like this. -Chicago Sun-Times
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,0.27,Waterloo (1970),"Bondarchuk is so overwhelmed by the thousands of Russian cavalry troops he's been given to play with, and by his $25 million budget, and by-his obsession for aerial photography, that his leading characters turn out scarcely more human than his extras. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Duffy (1968),"Duffy is a movie mostly made up of pauses. Unhappily, Parrish does not understand the pause, and so what we mostly get are dead spaces with James Coburn smiling enigmatically. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Going Home (1971),"Going Home is a fairly awful melodrama that's worth seeing primarily for the presence of Robert Mitchum. Not that he's especially good... It's just that he's there, the kind of screen presence that draws your attention. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Hero at Large (1980),"Hero at Large is a big, dumb, silly, good-hearted albatross of a comedy that may find an audience among John Ritter fans but did not find one with me. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Something Big (1971),I haven't seen a Dean Martin movie since How to Save A Marriage and Ruin Your Life where his talent was really used. -Chicago Sun-Times
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,0.67,The Return of Count Yorga (1971),"I'm convinced we're taking vampires, ghouls and zombies much too casually these days. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Crime and Passion (1976),"If you somehow find yourself viewing Crime and Passion, notice the complete confusion of plot and tone. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Where It's At (1969),"Janssen is the best thing in this dreary, disjointed project. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,0.17,Making It (1971),"Like the adolescent it's about, Making It has an inadequate attention span.The strange thing, though, is that a fundamentally good movie seems to be trying to break through the B.S. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,The Violent Four (1968),Never in your life have you seen so many cops and robbers hanging out the windows of speeding automobiles and machine-gunning each other. -Chicago Sun-Times
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight (1971),"One of the hazards of movie comedy is that it's almost impossible to be sure that what reads funny will look funny. The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight, an uncertain comedy based on Jimmy Breslin's funny novel, supplies plenty of examples. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,0.5,The Black Windmill (1974),"The Black Windmill commits the one crime no thriller can be pardoned for. It's not thrilling. It's also terribly passive and static, and Siegel directs Caine almost to a standstill. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Evil Knievel (1971),"The life of Evel Knievel contains the same seeds of self-doom as a Dostoevski character's. That's what I miss in the current George Hamilton movie version, despite its generally interesting texture and its flicks of black humor. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,0.4,The Last Run (1971),The movie forgets what kinds of characters it's developed and gives us an ending we can't accept. -Chicago Sun-Times
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Norman... Is That You? (1976),"The movie isn't much (and it's based on a Broadway play that was even less), but while Foxx is onscreen we're willing to forgive it a lot. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,0.63,A Matter of Time (1976),"The movie just doesn't hold together... And yet we sit in this failed movie and give our attention to Ingrid Bergman, and there is a certain consolation. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,T.R. Baskin (1971),"The problem is that everyone in the movie acts so stupidly. Real people of average intelligence would have cut through this plot in about three minutes, and the movie would have been over. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,The Marriage of a Young Stockbroker (1971),"The reason Marriage of a Young Stockbroker doesn't work, I imagine, is that it doesn't start from scratch in getting into the mind of its protagonist. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,The River Niger (1976),"The River Niger, a film about a series of crises in an American black family, has good intentions and several very well-acted scenes. But its direction is a mess. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Millhouse: A White Comedy (1971),"The thing about Millhouse is that the same film could have been made about anybody. It is not specifically, uniquely, or revealingly about Nixon. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime? (1975)","There are songs and production numbers from the great 1930s musicals and newsreel footage of the rioting strikers at Ford, and animated sequences, and Will Rogers kidding FDR and Rudy Vallee singing the title song. But to what purpose? -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Shadow of the Hawk (1976),"Vincent is one of the more engaging young American actors, but this time he's given almost nothing to work with. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,First Love (1970),"When a movie moves slowly we're supposed to appreciate the ""pacing,"" and it is a great day when a director ""succeeds in establishing a mood,"" even if that mood is boredom in the audience. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,0.5,Flashpoint (1984),"""Flashpoint"" is such a good thriller for so much of its length that it's kind of a betrayal when the ending falls apart. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,0.91,El Mariachi (1992),An enormously entertaining movie. -Chicago Sun-Times
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,--,Hugo and Josefin (1967),"At a time when every summer Saturday brings a rip-off kiddie matinee, this is a film to treasure. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,--,Echoes of Silence (1967),"Echoes of Silence is hardly a movie at all, in the way we ordinarily use the word, and yet it is a sincere and rather effective film. Its flaws are honest ones, made for the right reasons, and there is not a false moment in it. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,--,Contract (1980),"For American audiences, the movie works as a more general satire of social and political values. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,--,It Came From Hollywood (1982),Here is a movie that could save you years of watching the Late Late Show; it's like Creature Features died and went to heaven. -Chicago Sun-Times
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,--,Gospel (1982),"It just wants to be a concert film, and contains no offstage or biographical material about its performers. But seen simply as music and performance, it's a great experience. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,--,"Me, Natalie (1969)","Me, Natalie is a pleasant film, very funny at times, and the evidence in the audience was that women liked it enormously. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,0.67,King Lear (1971),"Shakespeare's Lear survives in his play and, will endure forever. Brook's Lear is a new conception, a rethinking, and a critical commentary on the play. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,0.93,The Atomic Cafe (1982),The Atomic Cafe is a chilling memory of life in the first years under the mushroom umbrella. -Chicago Sun-Times
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,0.93,Working Girls (1986),"The director, Lizzie Borden, has created characters who seem close to life, and her movie helps explain why the world's oldest profession is, despite everything, a profession. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,0.97,Sleepless Night (2011),"The film's headlong momentum streamrolls over all our questions, and we're carried along by the expertly choreographed action. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,--,Northern Lights (1979),"The filmmakers, John Hanson and Rob Nilsson, use the documentary springboard of Martinson's memories to move into a film that also looks like a documentary. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,--,Desperate Characters (1971),"The movie's characters are decent people, but morally exhausted. They have no way or desire to keep going; yet they hang on raggedly to a city existence that's taken any sense of balance or sanity. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,0.83,The Original Kings of Comedy (2000),"The Original Kings of Comedy doesn't have the theatrical subtext or, let it be said, the genius of Richard Pryor. But then again Pryor went out for an hour or 90 minutes and just talked. These guys are working in a revue format. -RogerEbert.com"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,--,The Penthouse (1989),"The Penthouse, quite simply, is a pretty good shocker. Shockers are standard fare in the movies and always have been, but successful ones are rare. It's a relief to find one that's made with skill and a certain amount of intelligence. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,0.89,Married to the Mob (1988),The results are very good - far better and funnier than most of what is being made these days. -Chicago Sun-Times
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,--,Paper Lion (1968),The scenes on the football field are absorbing and hilarious by turns; I imagine pro football fans will enjoy the movie enormously. -Chicago Sun-Times
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,--,Guns of the Trees (1961),"What Jonas Mekas has made in this film, perhaps without fully intending to, is a documentary of a style of life. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,0.77,Essential Killing (2010),"With ""Essential Killing,"" [Jerzy] Skolimowski comes closer than ever before to a pure, elemental story. -RogerEbert.com"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,--,Perfect Friday (1970),"A movie made of froth and sweep-second hands and Ursula Andress. It is of absolutely no consequence or importance at all, but it's nice while you're watching it. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,0.46,The Portrait of a Lady (1996),"I think if you care for James, you must see it. It is not an adaptation but an interpretation. It gives us Isabel from a new angle. And it is well acted. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,--,Jack Johnson (1971),"It is nearly always fascinating -- old, resurrected newsreel film affects me something like a time machine -- but it doesn't necessarily penetrate to the man Jack Johnson. We are left with the public figure. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,0.64,The Aristocats (1970),"The Aristocats is in there with the good ones. It is light and pleasant and funny, the characterization is strong, and the voices of Phil Harris and Eva Gabor are charming in their absolute rightness. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,1,Infra-Man (1975),"The movie's totally, almost joyfully absurd... It's a classy, slick production by the Shaw Brothers, the Hong Kong kung fu kings. When they stop making movies like Infra-Man, a little light will go out of the world. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,--,Joe Cocker: Mad Dogs & Englishmen (1971),"The sound is first rate, for one thing, and director Pierre Adidge has some idea of why Cocker electrifies a crowd. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,3,0.4,Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me? (1971),"There's a certain flabbiness in its philosophy. And yet, I reacted very favorably to some scenes in the film, and I think Hoffman's two long scenes with Barbara Harris are among the best cinema I've seen in some time. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,4,0.4,Elvira Madigan (1967),"Elvira Madigan is indeed remarkably beautiful, Almost every frame would make a painting, and yet the film is alive and cinematic, not simply photographs of pretty pictures. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,4,0.41,Camelot (1967),"Exactly what we were promised: ornate, visually beautiful, romantic and staged as the most lavish production in the history of the Hollywood musical. If that's what you like, you'll like it. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,4,--,"The Birds, the Bees and the Italians (1966)",Germi's films are filled with sheer love of movement and action and could be described as slapstick if they were not written so tightly and aimed so directly at satirical targets. -Chicago Sun-Times
Fresh,Robert Ebert,4,0.99,Le Havre (2011),"Here is the sunniest film I've seen by Aki Kaurismaki, and he reveals a lot of sunshine inside for a director whose world is usually filled with deadpan losers. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,4,0.92,Ace in the Hole (1951),"In a lesser movie, Tatum would share our sympathy for the pathetic man. Here, he's on a parabola in that direction but wants it to intersect with the moment of his own greatest fame. -RogerEbert.com"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,4,1,Diary of a Lost Girl (1929),"It's not the equal of Pandora's Box, but [Brooks's] performance is on the same high level. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,4,1,"Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr. (1999)","Like all of Morris' films, ""Mr. Death"" provides us with no comfortable place to stand. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,4,0.82,Hair (1979),"Maybe it's just as well that this version had to wait a decade to be filmed so Forman could be hired to do it. He brings life to the musical form in the same way that West Side Story did, the last time everyone was saying the movie musical was dead. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,4,0.9,Pale Flower (1964),"Pale Flower is one of the most haunting noirs I've seen, and something more; in 1964 it was an important work in an emerging Japanese New Wave of independent filmmakers, an exercise in existential cool. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,4,--,Play It as It Lays (1972),"Play It as It Lays is an astringent, cynical movie that ultimately manages to spin one single timid thread of hope. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,4,0.92,Mon Oncle d'Amerique (1980),"The characters are sympathetic, the narrative is well-constructed, and we care. But consider one sequence. In itself it is perfectly absorbing. Then see how Resnais deconstructs it. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,4,1,Vengeance Is Mine (1979),The film gathers fearful force. -Chicago Sun-Times
Fresh,Robert Ebert,4,--,Saving Face (2011),This heartbreaking film has relevance to the cruelties toward women that are sanctioned in many lands. -Chicago Sun-Times
Fresh,Robert Ebert,4,0.7,Pink Floyd - The Wall (1982),"This isn't the most fun to listen to and some viewers don't find it to much fun to watch, but the 1982 film is without question the best of all serious fiction films devoted to rock. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,4,0.93,Marat/Sade (1967),"Brook has achieved the very difficult. He has taken an important play, made it more immediate and powerful than it was on the stage, and at the same time created a distinguished and brilliant film. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,4,0.92,Heart of Glass (1976),"I think it should be approached like a piece of music, in which we comprehend everything in terms of mood and aura, and know how it makes us feel even if we can't say what it makes us think. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,4,0.92,The Magic Flute (1975),"Ingmar Bergman has never before made a movie so warm, happy and innocent... It's as if all this joy has been building up inside him during the great decade of metaphysical films beginning with Persona. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,4,1,Make Way for Tomorrow (1937),"It's easy to imagine it being sentimentalized by a studio executive, being made more upbeat for the audience. That's not McCarey. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,4,0.91,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971),"Probably the best film of its sort since The Wizard of Oz. It is everything that family movies usually claim to be, but aren't: Delightful, funny, scary, exciting, and, most of all, a genuine work of imagination. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,0.5,0.2,Mannequin (1987),"This movie is a real curiosity. It's dead. I don't mean it's bad. A lot of bad movies are fairly throbbing with life. Mannequin is dead. The wake lasts 1 1/2 hours, and then we can leave the theater. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,1,--,The Last Affair (1976),"The Last Affair is an appallingly bad movie - so completely bankrupt in ideas, in characterization, in simple common sense that it's little wonder its makers bought a theater to get it shown. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,1.5,--,Serial (1980),"... for all of that, Serial just isn't very good. I think maybe that's because the characters are seen almost exclusively as caricatures. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,1.5,0.89,The St. Valentine's Day Massacre (1967),"At the end of this nonsense, to be sure, there is a massacre to brighten things up a little. But then the pall sets in again. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,1.5,0.71,Dead Man (1995),"Dead Man is a strange, slow, unrewarding movie that provides us with more time to think about its meaning than with meaning. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,1.5,--,Broken Rainbow (1985),"If a documentary cannot convince us of its basic journalistic accuracy, then it is just opinion and polemic, and the material might have been treated more effectively as fiction. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,1.5,--,Lady Chatterley's Lover (1981),It's no use comparing the book and movie versions of Lady Chatterley's Lover. They do not exist in comparable terms. They have nothing to do with one another. -Chicago Sun-Times
Fresh,Robert Ebert,1.5,--,I Love You (1981),"The movie eventually arrives at a heavily symbolic ending, with the actors addressing the audience directly and bursting into song and dance. Metaphor-hunters are welcome to pick among the ruins for symbols and meanings. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,1.5,--,In God We Trust (1980),"The movie itself is a broadside attack on televised evangelists, particularly the kind who promise quick results from God if you send in your cash donations fast. This is an old target, and Feldman contributes nothing original to the attack. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,1.5,0.55,Bad Timing: A Sensual Obsession (1980),"This film has been praised for its honesty, but it would have taken far more honesty (not to mention courage) to deal with the personality disorders of these characters instead of simply burying them in blood, sex, and noise. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,1.5,0.33,"Yes, Giorgio (1982)","This is a bad movie, but it would have been a great deal worse were it not for Pavarotti's almost childlike charm. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,1.5,--,Jinxed! (1982),"This is a messed-up movie that throws away what few opportunities it has to entertain us, and gets totally lost in a plot that starts as comedy and moves through farce on its way to paralysis. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Live for Life (1967),[Live for Life] has all of the faults of A Man and a Women and none of the virtues and is an ugly and corrupt film which pretends to be beautiful and ethical. -Chicago Sun-Times
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Counterpoint (1968),"Counterpoint is possibly the most unlikely war movie of 1968, but it has a perverse charm and a lot of good classical music. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,0.2,Pendulum (2002),It's so badly written and indifferently directed that it degrades its subject; a few more movies like this could put lawnorder out of business for good. -Chicago Sun-Times
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,The Monkey Hustle (1976),"Monkey Hustle is a good-hearted muddle, a totally confused movie that manages to be fun from time to time. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Rotten,Robert Ebert,2,--,Mr. Ricco (1975),"Mr. Ricco keeps us waiting through two hours of yawn inducing ""suspense"" for an ending that's totally off the wall. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,2.5,0.64,The Bed Sitting Room (1969),"All of the characters are mad, of course, but that's not the point; this isn't a heavy-handed anti-war parable, but a series of sketches that gradually grow more and more grim. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,2.5,--,Galia (1966),"Georges Lautner's Galia opens and closes with arty shots of the ocean, mother of us all, but in between it's pretty clear that what is washing ashore is the French New Wave. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,2.5,0.14,Caprice (1967),"If [Doris Day's] movies never go anywhere, at least they don't take all day about it. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,2.5,0.42,My Life (1993),"My Life should be a more rigorous and single-minded film; maybe it started that way, before getting spoonfuls of honey to make the medicine go down. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,2.5,--,Lies My Father Told Me (1975),"No attempt is really made to make these people more than stereotypes, but they play their roles with sufficient gusto to make them interesting. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,2.5,--,Chuka (1967),"Rod Taylor's Chuka is an intelligently acted and directed Western that has been burdened, for some reason, with a plot so melodramatic that the effect is lost. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,2.5,0.75,The Chosen (1981),"The Chosen never came alive for me. I respected what the filmmakers were trying to do, and I admired the ambitious period production, but I never really cared about these people. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,2.5,--,The Happening (1967),"The film as a whole is well made, if a trifle slowly paced, and one or two of the comedy sequences are inspired. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,2.5,--,The Salamander (1971),"The movie finally doesn't quite win us over. It moves too slowly; it tries to do too much at its leisurely pace. We don't hate it, or want to walk out. We're just left a little too relaxed. -Chicago Sun-Times"

Fresh,Robert Ebert,2.5,--,The Valachi Papers (1972),"We're not involved enough to really care that much about Joe Valachi, and the movie becomes a series of high points on the road to a labored conclusion. -Chicago Sun-Times"
Fresh,Robert Ebert,2.5,0.5,Joe Hill (1971),"Widerberg doesn't take the Wobbly brand of anarcho-syndicalism, the ""one big union"" philosophy, at all seriously. It's not that he should; it's that the movie is lightweight because he doesn't. -Chicago Sun-Times"

Fresh,Robert Ebert,3.5,0.89,Taxi to the Toilet (1980),"Taxi zum Klo is an unsparingly honest film, documentary matched with (I assume) docudrama, in which Ripploh reveals himself fearlessly. -Chicago Sun-Times"
